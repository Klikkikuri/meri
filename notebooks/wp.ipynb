       " 'summary': \"Climate change refers to the human-induced rise in global temperatures, primarily driven by fossil fuel burning, deforestation, and certain agricultural and industrial practices that release greenhouse gases. Earth's average surface air temperature has increased nearly 1.5 °C since the Industrial Revolution, with the Arctic experiencing the most significant warming. The impacts of climate change include expanding deserts, more frequent heat waves and wildfires, thawing permafrost, retreating glaciers, and rising sea levels. These changes threaten human health, food and water security, and can lead to increased flooding, disease, and economic loss. The World Health Organization identifies climate change as a major global health threat. Without action to limit warming, societies and ecosystems face severe risks. The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming well under 2 °C, but current pledges may lead to a rise of about 2.8 °C by century's end. Achieving the 1.5 °C target requires halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Transitioning to renewable energy sources and enhancing carbon capture methods are essential for mitigating climate change.\",\n",

Warming from increased CO2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop. In 1896, he published the first [climate model](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_model \"Climate model\") of its kind, projecting that halving CO2 levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age. Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling CO2 to be around 5–6\\xa0°C.[\\\\[435]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELapenis1998-435) Other scientists were initially sceptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more CO2 would make no difference, and that the climate would be self-regulating.[\\\\[436]](#cite_note-Weart_The_Carbon_Dioxide_Greenhouse_Effect-436) Beginning in 1938, [Guy Stewart Callendar](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Stewart_Callendar \"Guy Stewart Callendar\") published evidence that climate was warming and CO2 levels were rising,[\\\\[437]](#cite_note-437) but his calculations met the same objections.[\\\\[436]](#cite_note-Weart_The_Carbon_Dioxide_Greenhouse_Effect-436)',\n",

Key developments in climate science include Gilbert Plass's 1950s computer model predicting warming from increased CO2, Hans Suess's evidence of rising CO2 levels, and Roger Revelle's findings on ocean absorption. The Keeling Curve, initiated by Charles Keeling, documented ongoing CO2 increases. The 1979 Charney Report supported climate models forecasting significant warming, and James Hansen's 1988 Senate testimony highlighted human causation and risks of global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), established in 1988, has facilitated interdisciplinary research and assessments of peer-reviewed literature. National science academies advocate for global emission reductions, and the 2021 IPCC Assessment Report confirmed that climate change is unequivocally human-caused.\",\n",

       "Climate change refers to the human-induced rise in global temperatures, primarily driven by fossil fuel burning, deforestation, and certain agricultural and industrial practices that release greenhouse gases. Earth's average surface air temperature has increased nearly 1.5 °C since the Industrial Revolution, with the Arctic experiencing the most significant warming. The impacts of climate change include expanding deserts, more frequent heat waves and wildfires, thawing permafrost, retreating glaciers, and rising sea levels. These changes threaten human health, food and water security, and can lead to increased flooding, disease, and economic loss. The World Health Organization identifies climate change as a major global health threat. Without action to limit warming, societies and ecosystems face severe risks. The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming well under 2 °C, but current pledges may lead to a rise of about 2.8 °C by century's end. Achieving the 1.5 °C target requires halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Transitioning to renewable energy sources and enhancing carbon capture methods are essential for mitigating climate change."
