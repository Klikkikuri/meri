## Output Format Instructions
{% raw %}
The output must be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below, but only return the actual instances without any additional schema definition.
As an example, for the schema `{"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}`
the object `{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}` is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object `{"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}` is not well-formatted.
{% endraw %}

Follow the output format strictly and do not include any additional text or explanations. The output **MUST** be a valid JSON object that matches the following schema:
```json
{{response_schema}}
```

{% if invalid_replies %}
### Incorrect Output format

!!!error
    Invalid Output on Previous Attempt

You already created the following output in a previous attempt:
{% for line in invalid_replies.splitlines() %}
> {{line}}
{% endfor %}

{% if error_message %}
However, this doesn't comply with the format requirements from above and triggered this Python exception:
```
{{error_message}}
```
Correct the output from the previous attempt according the exception to follow the provided schema.
{% else %}
Correct the output to follow the provided schema.
{% endif %}
Otherwise the content from previous attempt should stay the same.

{% endif %}
